Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, who received suggestions from Iowa architects. Among the local designers was the office of Proudfoot, Rawson, Souers and  Thomas, a highly respected Des Moines firm. This firm had designed high-profile public buildings in Iowa including the Polk County Courthouse in Des Moines and buildings for Iowa State University and the University of Iowa. Although little is known about the Dubuque architect involved in the project, Herbert Kennison, he probably served as an on-site consultant. The building’s cornerstone was laid in 1932, and a dedication ceremony was held the following year. The building was occupied in early 1934. Dubuque received approximately $650,000 for site acquisition and construction costs. Consolidation of postal service in the United States led to processing being moved to Cedar Rapids. The renamed Dubuque Federal Building was taken over by the City of Dubuque in 2006. No. 7A-H3766",,1940,,1940,2019-10-10,"Buettell Brothers Company (Dubuque, Iowa); Curteich and  Co., Inc.
